It is called the Personal AI Productivity Playbook, and by the end it will hold your own use cases, your own tested prompts, your own workflows, and your own safeguards. Every day adds one page to it. Nothing gets assembled at the last minute, because you build the real thing as you go. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® AI Fluency Framework, which moves through three stages: FRAME, then RUN, then TRUST. The ten days map onto that arc. You will see the stage marked at the top of every day, so you always know where you are in the path.",

It is called the AI Context Design Canvas, and by the end it will hold, for one real task of yours, a scoped prompt, the sources it depends on, the guardrails that keep it safe, the tools and memory it needs, and the review that keeps it reliable. Every day fills in one part of it. Nothing gets assembled at the last minute, because you build the real thing as you go. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® Context Design Canvas, which moves through five regions: SCOPE, then SUPPLY, then SHAPE, then STATE, then SUSTAIN. The ten days map onto that arc. You will see the region marked at the top of every day, so you always know where you are in the path. This framework is unusual in the catalog in that the framework is the artifact: the canvas you fill in is the method itself.",

  "description": "You are going to build one thing across ten days and keep it: a working AI agent that handles one bounded job from your real work, built without writing code. By the end it will run on its own trigger, use only the tools you allowed, stop and wait for a person at the points you chose, and hold up against the failure cases you tested. The first half of the course designs it on a one-page Agent Design Canvas. The second half builds it and proves it. Every day adds one piece, so nothing is assembled at the last minute. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® Agent Design Canvas, which moves through five stages: SELECT, then TOOL, then ESCALATE, then ENGINEER, then ROAD-TEST. Together they spell STEER, which is the point of the method: you stay in control of the agent from the first design choice to the last test. You will see the stage marked at the top of every day, so you always know where you are in the path. You will need access to a no-code automation or agent-building tool your organization approves. If you do not have one, use a free or trial workspace with test data only.",

A silent failure is the agent doing nothing, or skipping a step, while nobody notices.

The first half of the course prepares the knowledge and ends in a RAG Readiness Checklist. The second half builds the assistant, checks its answers against their sources, and proves it declines what it cannot support. Every day adds one piece, so nothing is assembled at the last minute. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® Knowledge Grounding Framework, which moves through six stages: GAP, then REFERENCES, then ORGANIZE, then UPLOAD, then NAME, then DEFEND. Together they spell GROUND, which is the whole point of the method: every answer stays tied to a trusted source. You will see the stage marked at the top of every day, so you always know where you are in the path. You will need access to a no-code assistant builder your organization approves, one that lets you upload documents and write instructions. If you have no sanitized documents of your own, use the USAII sample document set at the end of this document.",

Every day adds one page to it. Nothing gets assembled at the last minute, because you build the real thing as you go, on a real project. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® Project Delivery Framework, which moves through five stages: PLAN, then ITEMIZE, then LIST RISKS, then ORCHESTRATE, then TRACK.

Every day adds one page to it. Nothing gets assembled at the last minute, because you build the real thing as you go. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® Responsible HR-AI Framework, which moves through six stages: TARGET, then ATTRACT, then LAUNCH, then ENGAGE, then NAVIGATE, then TEST. The ten days map onto that arc. You will see the stage marked at the top of every day, so you always know where you are in the path.",

Every day adds one page to it. Nothing gets assembled at the last minute, because you build a real campaign as you go. The course is organized by one framework, The USAII® Campaign-to-Channel Framework, which moves through five stages: RESEARCH, then EXPRESS, then ADAPT, then CALIBRATE, then HONE. The ten days map onto that arc. You will see the stage marked at the top of every day, so you always know where you are in the path.",
