/**
 * Pass / Needs Work rubrics from the USAII grading sheets.
 *
 * Course 1 (AI Fluency for the Workplace): the Personal AI Productivity Playbook is reviewed on
 * five dimensions at Day 10. Courses 6, 7 and 8 work the same way with their own sheets: the AI Project
 * Management Toolkit, the AI HR Use-Case Playbook and the AI Campaign Builder Template. All five must pass to earn the certificate; work that needs work is
 * returned once with feedback, and the revision is capped at one round.
 *
 * `evidence` names the daily activities that hold each dimension's evidence. The LMS checks those
 * pages automatically and shows them beside the evidence package, so the reviewer reads the whole
 * playbook in one place. To add the rubric of another course, add an entry here (or build it in
 * Course Builder → Lesson → Activity → "Pass / Needs Work rubric").
